##Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

featDomain        Feature: Time domain signal or frequency domain signal (Time or Freq) 
featInstrument    Feature: Measuring instrument (Accelerometer or Gyroscope) 
featAcceleration  Feature: Acceleration signal (Body or Gravity) 
featVariable      Feature: Variable (Mean or SD) 
featJerk          Feature: Jerk signal 
featMagnitude     Feature: Magnitude of the signals calculated using the Euclidean norm 
featAxis          Feature: 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions (X, Y, or Z) 
featCount         Feature: Count of data points used to compute  average  
featAverage       Feature: Average of each variable for each activity and each subject
