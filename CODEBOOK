The following has been done to achieve the tidied dataset:
1.Process names of the variables ◦Names of the variables are read from the file "features.txt"
Names are sanitized to replace the characters "(" ,")" and "-" (Refer to R reference documentation on make.names for definition on valid names)
◦Names are converted to lowercase

2.Process test Dataset ◦Read list of subject id from "subject_test.txt"
  ◦Read list of activity id from "y_test.txt"
  ◦Read list of data from "X_test.txt" and replace with headers from #1
  ◦Concatenate subject id, activity id and data together
  ◦Extract only the mean and standard deviation measurements for each subject id and activity id. ◾NOTE: Referring to "features_info.txt", only the following variables are considered as mean and standard deviation measurements ◾mean()
◾std()



3.Process train Dataset ◦Repeat the same steps for test Dataset on the train Dataset and corresponding files.

4.Processed datasets from #2 and #3 are combined.
5.The required data is then extracted ◦Read in activity names from "activity_labels.txt"
◦Merge activity names with the combined dataset from #4
◦"Activity ID" variable is then removed

6.Tidied data is derived from #5 by performing the following ◦Required data is aggregated and grouped by subject id and activity name. The aggreate function is the average i.e. arithmetic mean
◦duplicate subject id and activity name variables resulting from the aggregation is removed
◦activity names in the oberservations are converted to lowercase
◦data variable names are appened with "average_"

7.Tidied data is saved to TXT and CSV files
